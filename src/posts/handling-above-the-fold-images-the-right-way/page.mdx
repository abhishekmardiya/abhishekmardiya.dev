# Handling Above-the-Fold Images the Right Way

<DateStamp>February 2026</DateStamp>

Images in the viewport on first paint should load immediately. Lazy loading them hurts LCP and makes content pop in late.

## The Problem

When image is lazy loaded, browsers defer loading until the image nears the viewport. That's great for images further down the page—but for hero images, thumbnails, or any image visible without scrolling, it delays the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and feels sluggish.

## The Fix

Mark above-the-fold images as eager:

- **`loading="eager"`** — Tells the browser to fetch the image right away instead of waiting.
- **`fetchpriority="high"`** — Add this only when the image is the LCP element

```html
<img
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero"
  loading="eager" // default is "eager"
  fetchpriority="high" // default is "auto"
/>
```

Or with Next.js `Image`:

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

<Image 
  src="/hero.jpg" 
  alt="Hero" 
  loading="eager" // default is "lazy"
  fetchpriority="high" // default is "auto"
/>
```

Note: Starting with `Next.js 16`, the `priority` property has been deprecated.

## Rule of Thumb

- **Above the fold:** `loading="eager"` (If the image is the LCP element, also add `fetchpriority="high"`)
- **Below the fold:** Keep `loading="lazy"`


## How to use `fetchpriority` correctly

If you set `fetchpriority="high"` on all images:

- **Browser loses prioritization signal** — There's no hierarchy for the browser to follow
- **Everything becomes equally urgent** — The browser can't tell what actually matters
- **LCP might actually slow down** — Competing high-priority fetches can delay the real LCP element

Priority hints only work when used selectively. Reserve `fetchpriority="high"` for your single LCP image (usually the hero or first meaningful image).

## See it in action

<Image src="/blog/lcp-example.webp" alt="Layout with one large image and four thumbnails" />

Consider a layout with 1 large main image on the left and 4 smaller thumbnails on the right, all visible immediately (above the fold).

**Should you give high priority to all 5 images?**

> Short answer: No.

### Main Large Image

This is almost certainly your LCP element.

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `loading` | `eager` |
| `fetchpriority` | `high` |

It is the biggest, dominates the viewport, and will likely be measured as LCP.

### The 4 Side Thumbnails

Above-the-fold thumbnails, not LCP.

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `loading` | `eager` |
| `fetchpriority` | `auto` |

Eager load them so they appear quickly, but leave `fetchpriority` as `auto` so the browser prioritizes the main LCP image first.

## Wrap Up

A solid image loading strategy can noticeably improve performance. The browser gets clear signals on what matters most, and users see key content sooner. **Small tweaks, better Core Web Vitals.**
