# Handling Above-the-Fold Images the Right Way

Images in the viewport on first paint should load immediately. Lazy loading them hurts LCP and makes content pop in late.

## The Problem

When image is lazy loaded, browsers defer loading until the image nears the viewport. That's great for images further down the page—but for hero images, thumbnails, or any image visible without scrolling, it delays the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and feels sluggish.

## The Fix

Mark above-the-fold images as eager:

- **`loading="eager"`** — Tells the browser to fetch the image right away instead of waiting.

- **`fetchpriority="high"`** — Add this only when the image is the LCP element

```html
<img
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Hero"
  loading="eager" // default is "eager"
  fetchpriority="high" // default is "auto"
/>
```

Or with Next.js `Image`:

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

<Image src="/hero.jpg" alt="Hero" loading="eager" /> // default is "lazy"
```

Note: Starting with `Next.js 16`, the `priority` property has been deprecated.

## Rule of Thumb

- **Above the fold:** `loading="eager"` (If the image is the LCP element, also add `fetchpriority="high"`)

- **Below the fold:** Keep `loading="lazy"`

Keep the first image or two eager; lazy load the rest.
